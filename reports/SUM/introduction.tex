\chapter{Introduction}

This document is the Software User Manual (SUM) of the software delivered by the ESA activity ITT-1-9873-ESA (i.e., the \emph{FAQAS framework}).
\REVOCT{typo-fixed}{The FAQAS framework consists of the following software: a toolset  implementing code-driven mutation analysis (MASS), a toolset implementing code-driven test generation, a toolset implementing data-driven mutation analysis (DAMAt), a toolset implementing data-driven test generation.}

 %to be delivered by ITT-1-9873-ESA.
This document follows the structure described in ECSS-E-ST-40C Annex B. Chapters' titles indicate the name of the software referred to.
%in the SoW \emph{AO9873-ws00pe\_SOW.pdf}, it provides instructions for the users of the FAQAS framework according to .

 %\TODO{We have to decide if we want to put code-driven and data-driven in the same manual. We shuold explain our choice here.}

% \TODO{Check my changes above}
