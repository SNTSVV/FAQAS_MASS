\chapter{MASS - Operations Environment}
\label{chapter:operations}

%\REVISION{P-1}{
\section{Hardware Configuration - Single Machine}

The \MASS toolset uses a host computer with the Linux operating system. \MASS needs the following hardware requirements to be executed on single machines:

\begin{itemize}
	\item x86\_64 PC architecture
	\item 4\,096 MB of RAM
	\item Intel i3 (or equivalent) processor
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware Configuration - High Performance Computing (HPC)}

The \MASS toolset can be also executed on HPC infrastructures. \REVOCT{P-3}{A HPC infrastructure is a supercomputer were the computing resources of several single computers are combined into one large computer with a high level of performance. For replicability, in the following, we describe the main characteristics of the University of Luxembourg HPC, where MASS experiments were performed.} 

\begin{itemize}
	\item HPC CPU processors: Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4 (2.4 GHz)
	\item HPC nodes memory: 112 gb
	\item Operative system: CentOS 7 x86\_64 GNU/Linux
	\item Job scheduler: \texttt{slurm 20.11.7}
\end{itemize}

Instead, these are the minimum hardware configurations to be set on HPCs for a single job:

\begin{itemize}
	\item CPU per task: 2
	\item Memory per CPU: 4\,096 MB of RAM
\end{itemize}

\section{Software Configuration}

\MASS integrates the \texttt{SRCMutation} component from \texttt{SRCIRor} mutation analysis tool\footnote{https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/srciror}. The installation of \texttt{SRCMutation} makes part of \MASS installation (see \ref{sec:install}).

In order to perform its tasks, \MASS also requires a few external components listed in the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item clang-3.8
	\item r-base (package binom)
	\item jq
	\item Python-3.7 or higher (packages numpy and scipy)
	\item bash 4.4 or higher
\end{itemize}
%}

\REVOCT{P-4}{Note that these components shall be installed by the user before the actual MASS installation.}


\chapter{SEMUS - Operations Environment}
\label{chapter:semus:operationsEnv}

\section{Hardware Configuration - Single Machine}

The \SEMUS toolset uses a host computer with the Linux operating system. \SEMUS needs the following hardware requirements to be executed on single machines:

\begin{itemize}
	\item x86\_64 PC architecture
	\item 4\,096 MB of RAM
	\item Intel i3 (or equivalent) processor
\end{itemize}


\section{Software Configuration}

\SEMUS integrates \SEMU, a symbolic execution-based mutation analysis engine, and thus it is necessary to install it before running \SEMUS. \SEMUS includes a Dockerfile that provides the necessary commands to install \SEMU and \SEMUS.

In order to perform its tasks, \SEMUS requires these components previously installed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{Docker} (\texttt{docker-ce} \texttt{docker-ce-cli} \texttt{containerd.io})
\end{itemize}


\chapter{DAMAt - Operations Environment}
\label{chapter:dama:operationsEnv}

\section{Hardware Configuration - Single Machine}

The \DAMA toolset uses a host computer with the Linux operating system. \DAMA needs the following hardware requirements to be executed on single machines:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{Python 3.6.8} or higher
	\item \texttt{GNU bash, version 4.2.46} or higher
\end{itemize}
