\chapter{External View of the Software}

The \FAQAS is delivered as an archive consisting of the source files and a installer.
The following is a depiction of the directory structure:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{FAQASFramework/}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{SRCMutation/}: contains the source files of the component that performs source mutations. 
		\item \texttt{llvm-build.sh}: build script that compiles the SRCMutation component
		\item \texttt{PythonWrappers/}: contains Python script wrappers that facilitate source code mutations.
		\item \texttt{MASS/}
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item \texttt{FAQAS-Setup}: contains the Bash scripts necessary to install the FAQAS-Framework.
			\item \texttt{FAQAS-GenerateCodeCoverageMatrixes}: contains the Bash scripts providing procedures to collect code coverage from the SUT.
			\item \texttt{FAQAS-GenerateMutants}: contains a Bash script that invokes the \texttt{SRCMutation} to generate mutants. 
			\item \texttt{FAQAS-CompileOptimizedMutants}: contains the Python and Bash scripts that provides the procedures to compile mutants and filter equivalent and redundant mutants based on trivial compiler optimizations.
			\item \texttt{FAQAS-CompileAndExecuteMutants}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \texttt{FAQAS-GeneratePrioritizedTestSuite}: contains the Python and Bash scripts that provides the procedures to generate prioritized and reduced test suites from the SUT.

				\item \texttt{FAQAS-CompileAndExecute}: contains the Python and Bash scripts that provides the procedures to compile and execute the mutants against the SUT test suite. It also provides the procedures to determine the mutation stopping criterion (i.e., mutant sampling).
	
				\item \texttt{FAQAS-IdentifyEquivalentAndRedundantMutants}: contains the Python and Bash scripts that provides the procedures to identify equivalent mutants based on code coverage.
			\end{itemize}
			\item \texttt{FAQAS-MutationScore}: contains the Python and Bash scripts that provides the procedures to compute the mutation score and provide summarized information about the code-driven mutation testing process.
		\end{itemize}
