DAMAt: the use of a HPC is not necessary for DAMAt, because the number of mutants generated by the data-driven mutation procedure is considerably lower than the number of mutants generated by code-driven, usually less than a hundred for case study.

SEMuS: the use of a HPC is not needed for SEMuS; we have introduced in Deliverable D4 Section~2.3.4 an histogram of the execution time of all test cases generated for both ASN.1 and MLFS, showing that in 89.11\% of the mutants the test generation takes less than 5 minutes. See comment on Section~\ref{chapter:semus:operationsEnv}.

% However, the current implementation of SEMuS does not automate the test generation for all live mutants, instead, the user needs to manually configure the test generation for each source under test. In order to facilitate the use of SEMuS, we will automate this step in WP4.

Done, now the Software View represents the content of the package.

We provided in Chapter~\ref{chapter:operations} a sentence explaining what a HPC platform is, and a brief list of the characteristics of the UL HPC platform.
The launcher scripts we provide in MASS will work in any HPC platform with \texttt{slurm} being configured as the default job scheduler.

We provided a sentence in Chapter~\ref{chapter:operations} explaining that the user shall take care of installing those component before the actual installation of MASS.

We added a proper reference to the mathematical library in the text, along with its website, in Section~\ref{sec:mass:introduction}.
We have included the MLFS together with the framework, particularly, it can be found in the folder \url{MASS/examples/mlfs}.
% We do not think it is necessary to deliver the MLFS together with the framework, since the library can be regularly downloaded from ESA website, and it has not been updated since 2018-09-04.

The tutorials were followed by LuxSpace and we are waiting for a response from GomSpace after we delivered the tool to them.
