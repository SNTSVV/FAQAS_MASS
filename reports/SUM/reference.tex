\REVISION{P-2}{

\section{Code-driven mutation analysis toolset (MASS)}

\MASS shall support the following commands:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{PrepareSUT}: command to prepare the SUT and collect information about the SUT test suite.
	\item \texttt{GenerateMutants}: command to generate mutants from the SUT source code.
	\item \texttt{CompileOptimizedMutants}: command to compile the mutants with the multiple optimisation levels.
	\item \texttt{OptimizedPostProcessing}: command to disregard equivalent and redundant mutants based on compiler optimisations.
	\item \texttt{GeneratePTS}: command to generate the prioritized and reduced test suites.
	\item \texttt{ExecuteMutants}: command to execute mutants against the SUT test suite.
	\item \texttt{IdentifyEquivalents}: command to identify equivalent mutants based on code coverage.
	\item \texttt{MutationScore}: command to compute the mutation score and final reporting.
	\item \texttt{PrepareMutants\_HPC}: command to prepare the mutants workspace for the execution on HPCs.
	\item \texttt{ExecuteMutants\_HPC}: command to execute mutants on HPCs.
	\item \texttt{PostMutation\_HPC}: command to assess past mutant executions, and to decide whether more mutant executions are needed.
\end{itemize}

For more information about how to operate each command, please refer to Section~\ref{sec:launchers}.
