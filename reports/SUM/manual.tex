\section{Set-up and Initialization}

\MASS strongly depends on LLVM for source code mutation. For this reason, the set-up procedure consists of installing LLVM-3.8.1 and the \texttt{SRCMutation} component. For this procedure, a Bash script is provided.

Examples: the following shell command installs the corresponding dependencies and the \texttt{SRCMutation} component installation.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ ./llvm-build.sh
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Getting started}

\MASS shall create a workspace folder where all the steps from the methodology shall be stored. 

An installation Bash script is provided for the creation of this workspace, the script can be found on \texttt{\$FAQAS/MASS/FAQAS-Setup/install.sh}

To use the installation script the shell variable \texttt{INSTALL\_DIR} has to be set:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ export INSTALL_DIR=/opt/MLFS
\end{lstlisting}

If \MASS will run inside a container (i.e., the \texttt{INSTALL\_DIR} must be binded inside a container), then also the shell variable \texttt{EXECUTION\_DIR} has to be set. This step is optional.

After setting the corresponding variables, the following commands are necessary to create the \MASS workspace folder:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ cd $FAQAS/MASS/FAQAS-Setup
  $ ./install.sh
\end{lstlisting}


Once the installation folder has been created, the folder shall contain the following structure:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{Launcher.sh}
	\item \texttt{mass_conf.sh}
	\item \texttt{mutation_additional_functions.sh}
	\item \texttt{MASS_STEPS_LAUNCHERS/CompileOptimizedMutants.sh}
	\item \texttt{MASS_STEPS_LAUNCHERS/OptimizedPostProcessing.sh}
	\item \texttt{MASS_STEPS_LAUNCHERS/PrepareSUT.sh}
	\item \texttt{MASS_STEPS_LAUNCHERS/MutationScore.sh}
	\item \texttt{MASS_STEPS_LAUNCHERS/ExecuteMutants.sh}
	\item \texttt{MASS_STEPS_LAUNCHERS/GenerateMutants.sh}
	\item \texttt{MASS_STEPS_LAUNCHERS/IdentifyEquivalents.sh}
	\item \texttt{MASS_STEPS_LAUNCHERS/GeneratePTS.sh}
\end{itemize}
