\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:conclusion}


In this book, we provided an overview of \EMPH{code-driven} and \EMPH{data-driven} \EMPH{mutation testing} with a focus on its application on \EMPH{space software}. Code-driven mutation testing relies on the automated injection of faults into the source code of the software under test. Data-driven mutation testing relies on the automated modification of the data exchanged by software components.

The presented processes cover both the \EMPH{assessment of test suites} and their \EMPH{improvement}. In addition, we have provided an overview of the building blocks of the two processes, i.e., solutions that should be put in place to minimize problems concerning \EMPH{scalability} and \EMPH{representativeness} of the mutation testing results.

We have shown that most of the recent research work focused on improving scalability and representativeness problems. Despite literature lacks of work evaluating the adoption of mutation testing in industrial contexts, the results achieved with large opensource systems shed a light on the possible integration of mutation testing in \EMPH{industry practices}.
