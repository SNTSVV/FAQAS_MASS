\subsection{Reduce/Prioritise Test Cases}
\label{sub:reduceprioritise}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Reduce: removal of test cases that are somehow redundant.
		\todoinline{which type of redundancy the focus on?}
	\item Prioritise: ordering test cases in a way that mutants are killed as early as possible.
\end{itemize}
