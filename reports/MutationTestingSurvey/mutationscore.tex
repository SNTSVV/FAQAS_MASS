\section{Mutation Score}\label{sec:mutationscore}

Mutation score calculation and refinement
\begin{itemize}
	\item Critical: observing and comparing program outputs often requires a test driver that it is program specific and, thus, researchers usually approximate program outputs by observing a subset of it, usually defined by the test assertions (and program crashes)
	\item Critical: Computing mutation score requires removal of equivalent mutants
	\item Critical: Mutant selection and classification strategies.
	\item Mutant selection provides opportunities to achieve good trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency
	\item Critical: definition of the mutation score threshold (measuring the relationship between mutation score and fault revelation). Few studies in this area.
	\item Higher mutation scores improves significantly the fault detection
	\item Critical: Equivalent and redundant mutants tends to obscure the mutation score.
\end{itemize}
