Missing VCDU/Packet& A VCDU/Packet is omitted during transmission.\\
Wrong Sequence& VCDUs/Packets are sent out of order. \\
Incorrect Identifier& Several transmission data fields have fixed values, for example fields identifying the transmitting satellite. Hardware/software errors may assign incorrect identifiers.\\
Incorrect Checksum& Hardware/software errors may result in an incorrect checksum for a Packet or VCDU.\\
Incorrect Counter& Counters are used to track Packet or VCDU ordering. Hardware/software errors may assign incorrect counter values.\\
Flipped Data Bits& Physical channel noise may flip one or more bits in the data transmission.\\
