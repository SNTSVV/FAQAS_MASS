Fuzzing & Data Processing Faults & none & Fuzzing techniques replace values with values (i.e., fuzz values) that are different and, usually, randomly generated. & Structured input data (e.g., files, streams) & \Fuzz, \Ballista \\
Grammar-based fuzzing & Data Processing Faults & Grammars  & This fuzzing approach relies on a grammar that describes the format of the data to be altered; new values are generated either based on the production rules of the grammar, or according to mutation operators specific for each symbol of the grammar. The use of the grammar decreases the chances of generating invalid inputs. & Structured input data (e.g., files, streams) & \MUSQL, \SOLMI, \Superion, \MongoDB \\
Evolutionary fuzzing & Data Processing Faults & none & This fuzzing approach relies on evolutionary algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms) to generate fuzz values. It relies on a fitness function to maximize structural coverage (e.g., branches executed during testing). The fitness is implemented by instrumenting the code of the application to collect code coverage. & Structured input data (e.g., files, streams) & \AFL \\
Whitebox fuzzing & Data Processing Faults & none & This fuzzing approach relies on symbolic execution techniques to cover corners cases on the different execution paths. & Structured input data (e.g., files, streams) & \SAGE \cite{bounimova2013billions} \\
Parser-directed fuzzing & Data Processing Faults & none & This fuzzing approach is applied to programs that integrate a parser component to extract information from the provided inputs. It is implemented through a test generator technique that aims to produce valid inputs for the parser, the inputs are produced randomly and then checked using constraint solving techniques. & Structured input data (e.g., files, streams) & \pFuzzer \\
\CHANGEDTWO{Model-based fuzzing}& \CHANGEDTWO{Data Processing Faults, Communication Faults} & Block models & \CHANGEDTWO{Fuzzing techniques replace a correct value with a newly generated one; in this case, the replacement is done through mutation operators tailored to a predefined set of data types. The model should specify the format of the data to be mutated including integrity constraints. They are also used to alter protocol messages or generating new ones, based on the provided model.}& Structured input data (e.g., files, streams) & \MoWF \cite{PeachFuzzer}, \cite{PeachMozilla}, \cite{BooFuzz}, \cite{spike}\\
%data-type based injection & Data Processing Faults & This operator replaces a value with an invalid one, selected on the basis of the type of the parameter being corrupted. & Structured input data (e.g., files, streams) & \Fuzz, \Ballista, \RIDDLE \\
Model-based data mutation & Data Processing Faults & UML models & This approach alters existing inputs by relying on a data model that capture the structure of the data and the constraints among data fields. A predefined set of operators indicating how to alter data based on its structure are provided. & Structured input data (e.g., files, streams) & \DiNardoICST \\
Search-based data mutation & Data Processing Faults &UML models & This approach alters existing inputs by relying on a data model that captures the structure of the data and the constraints between data fields. A search-based, evolutionary algorithm is used to maximize a number of mutation objectives including the number of constraints being violated and code coverage. & Structured input data (e.g., files, streams) & \DiNardoASE \\
Signal mutation & Signal faults & Simulink models & This approach alters signal by either shifting the signal based on a randomly selected value or shifting the signal and increasing the number of signal pieces (i.e., segments).  & Input signals & \Matinnejad \\
