The purpose of the Chapter~\ref{chapter:caseStudies} is to present an overview of the case study systems of the FAQAS activity, and furthermore to introduce some preliminary results. More importantly, the different approaches presented in FAQAS cannot be evaluated in the same way, and thus, we need dedicated chapters were we present in details the empirical evaluation that we carried on code-driven mutation analysis (see Chapter~\ref{sec:testSuiteEvaluation:codeDriven}), code-driven mutation test suite augmentation (see Chapter~\ref{sec:testGeneration:codeDriven}), and data-driven mutation analysis (see Chapter~\ref{sec:testSuiteEvaluation:dataDriven}).

However, we added Section~\ref{sec:summary:results} that reports a summary of the output of the multiple FAQAS approaches (e.g., mutation scores, number of test cases generated).

We provide the ESAIL XXX test suite statement coverage, which is the information necessary to perform the different MASS optimizations. We do not provide more detailed coverage information (i.e., function and branch coverage); since its measurement in our testing facilities interferes with the real-time requirements of the test suite, and more importantly, they are not necessary for MASS optimizations.

We did not make a preliminary assessment of the Libparam case study. Given that the environmental setup of the library was identical to Libutil and Libgscsp GSL case studies, we proceeded to directly perform a complete evaluation of Libparam, presented in Section~\ref{sec:testSuiteEvaluation:codeDriven}.

Actually, with the exception of \SAIL{}, we are comparing MASS to the truth, i.e., a mutation analysis process were all the mutants are considered and executed against the complete test suite. In the case of \SAIL, we defined \SAIL{}$_S$ to be our complete set (i.e., 3,535 mutants), since the actual complete set (i.e., 78\,203 mutants) would not be possible to analyze in the time frame of the FAQAS project. 

However, we added a phrase to the design paragraph of the research question to avoid wrong interpretations.

As specified in Section~\ref{sec:threats:damat}, our results generalize for systems with architectures similar to \SAIL, which is a state-of-the-art system in terms of CPS software.

We meant adding oracles that verify data values already produced by the software under test. We added an additional phrase in Section~\ref{sec:rq2:damat} to clarify it.

\TODO{Probably would be a good idea before submitting this revision, to try again with the updated version of SEMuS, and report in Chapter 1, as a feasibility study the problems we found when applying SEMuS to ESAIL.}
SEMuS relies on the KLEE symbolic execution engine for test generation. KLEE requires that programs passed as input shall be compiled in LLVM bitcode format. In Deliverable D2 section 1.2.3.7, we presented a feasibility study showing that ESAIL cannot be compiled in LLVM bitcode format because of incompatibility of libraries between clang (LLVM compiler) and RTEMS (ESAIL compiler). 

However, we added a phrase explaining the aforementioned problem.
\end{minipage}\\
\\
\hline  
TDR-D4-PABG-20&
\begin{minipage}{12cm}
The quality of the test cases generated by the technique is high. SEMuS enable us to generate test inputs that kill mutants not previously detected by existing test suites. The test cases generated by SEMuS increases the overall quality of a test suite because (1) cover input partitions not previously considered, (2) evidence the lack of oracles in the test suite, and (3) in some cases, it might spot defects in the code (as already presented in Section~\ref{sec:shortcoming:semus}).
