\chapter{Software Reuse Analysis Conclusion}

\section{MASS}

SRCIROR will be reused as base for \MASS software in compliance with with ESA ECSS-E-ST-40 and ECSS-Q-ST-80.
\texttt{SRCMutation} and \texttt{PythonWrappers} are the only software items that will be reused for the development of \MASS.
The concrete subset of SRCIROR to be reused is defined in Section~\ref{sec:mass:reuse}.
This re-engineering activity will be validated with space software case study systems.

\section{SEMuS}

\SEMU will be reused as base for \SEMUS software in compliance with with ESA ECSS-E-ST-40 and ECSS-Q-ST-80.
\texttt{ExecutionState\_KS}, \texttt{Executor\_KS}, \texttt{klee-semu} are the only software items that will be reused for the development of \SEMUS.
The concrete subset of \SEMU to be reused is defined in Section~\ref{sec:semus:reuse}.
This re-engineering activity will be validated with space software case study systems.
