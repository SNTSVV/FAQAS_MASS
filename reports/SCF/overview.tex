\chapter{Software Configuration Item Overview}

\section{Brief Description}

The software configuration item for the SCF consists of the software deliverables of FAQAS framework (i.e., \MASS, \SEMUS, \DAMA). The FAQAS framework is designed to be used for testing space software running in UNIX environments. The goal of the software include in this CI is to facilitate the verification and validation of ECSS compliant projects.

\end{figure}

All information about the software configuration item is stored in the documents specified in Chapter~\ref{chapter:baseline}: the procedure on how to build and use the different software (i.e., \MASS, \SEMUS, \DAMA) can be found in the Software User Manual (SUM), and the Software Reuse File (SRF), defines the software reused in this project.

The platform to track the development process is the University of Luxembourg's GitLab Repository\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.uni.lu}}; the platform provides a Git repository where the development of each source code file can be traced.

\section{CI Composition}

The CI documentation is provided in Chapter~\ref{chapter:baseline}, while the corresponding software source code and building procedures are listed in Section~\ref{sec:code_list}.

\section{Means to Develop, Modify, Install, and Run the CI}

The CI is delivered as source code. The instructions to install and execute the CI are described in the SUM document, while for the specifications and design of the software the Software Design Document (SDD), and Software System Specification (SSS) document shall be consulted.
