The activity \emph{Execute FAQAS-GenerateDataDrivenReachabiliyAssertions} in Figure~\ref{fig:process:dataDriven:augment} concerns the execution of the program \emph{Execute FAQAS-GenerateDataDrivenReachabiliyAssertions}.

The program \emph{FAQAS-GenerateDataDrivenReachabiliyAssertions} takes as input the fault model and generates a version of \emph{FAQAS\_dataDrivenMutator.h} that contains reachability assertions that enable KLEE to generate inputs that reach the mutation.

The activity \emph{Execute KLEE} indicates that the end-user should execute KLEE, after performing the required scaffolding, if necessary. A methodological procedure document to support the end-user will be provided.

The activity \emph{Implement test case} indicates that the end-user should implement a test case based on KLEE's output.
