\chapter{Software Design}

This \FAQAS consists of three components implementing the different features of the proposed approach:
\begin{itemize}
	\item code-driven mutation analysis toolset (MASS)
	\item code-driven test generation toolset (SEMuS)
	\item data-driven mutation analysis toolset (DaMAT)
\end{itemize}

The three components listed above are described separately in the following sections. Within FAQAS, we only evaluated the possibility to implement data-driven test generation but it has not been feasible to implement a working toolset (i.e., the data-driven test generation toolset, DAMTE). The DAMTE process is however presented in a dedicated Section.
