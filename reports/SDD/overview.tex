\chapter{Software Design}

This \FAQAS consists of four components implementing the different features of the proposed approach:
\begin{itemize}
	\item code-driven mutation analysis toolset (MASS)
	\item code-driven test generation toolset (FAQAS-SEMu)
	\item data-driven mutation analysis toolset (DataDrivenMutator)
	\item data-driven test generation toolset
\end{itemize}

The four components listed above are described separately in the following sections\footnote{Issue 1 of this document reports only about MASS}.
