\chapter{Introduction}

This document is the deliverable SDD of the ESA activity ITT-1-9873-ESA. Its purpose is to describe the architectural design and the detailed design of the software to be delivered by ITT-1-9873-ESA. 

This document follows a structure derived from tailoring of ECSS-E-ST-40C Annex F.
% Since the \emph{FAQAS framework} implements two distinct functionalities, code-driven mutation testing and data-driven mutation testing, this document contains two separate chapters, each one concerning one of the two features: Chapter~\ref{chapter:codeDriven} concerns code-driven mutation testing, Chapter~\ref{chapter:dataDriven} concerns data-driven mutation testing.
