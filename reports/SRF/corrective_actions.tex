\chapter{Corrective Actions}

\section{MASS}

The following corrective actions have been carried out on the reused software in creating \MASS:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Removal of the component IRMutation.
	\item Removal of the folders Demo and Examples.
	\item Implementation of the new mutation operators in the SRCMutation component: ABS, SDL, AOD, LOD, ROD, BOD, SOD, LVR.
	\item Implementation of meta mutant information; now SRCMutation produces a meta-mutant.info file providing information about every mutation present in the source file, this is useful for integration with \SEMUS.
	\item Improvement of the Python Wrapper for the SRCMutation component, now (1) it supports the selection of mutation operators to be used during mutation analysis, and (2) it handles C++ files correctly
\end{itemize}
