\chapter{Introduction}

This document is the Software Reuse File (SRF) of the software delivered by the ESA activity ITT-1-9873-ESA (i.e., the \emph{FAQAS framework}).
The FAQAS framework consists of the following software: a toolset  implementing code-driven mutation analysis (\MASS), a toolset implementing code-driven test generation (\SEMUS), a toolset implementing data-driven mutation analysis (\DAMA), a toolset implementing data-driven test generation. The current version of the manual refers to the software released so far (i.e., \MASS, \DAMA, and \SEMUS).

This document follows the structure described in ECSS-E-ST-40C Annex B. Chapters' titles indicate the name of the software referred to.
