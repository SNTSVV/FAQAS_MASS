\subsection{Overview of the case study}

The \INDEX{Mathematical Library for Flight Software} (MLFS) implements mathematical functions ready for qualification. 
%\DONE{Please rewrite the following sentence}
MLFS is born from the need of having a mathematical library ready for qualification for flight software. Well known mathematical libraries such as \texttt{libm}~\cite{libm} and \texttt{newlib}~\cite{newlib} are not completely validated with respect to specific input ranges, errors and performance, and so, they do not comply with ECSS criticality category B.
The set of functions provided by MLFS are limited to the functions typically needed in flight software. 


The source code size is 5\,402 LOC, while the unit test suite consists of 4\,042 tests for 92 functions.
