\subsection{Mutation Score Calculation}
\label{sub:mutationscore}

%\DONE{Is there anything we can add here?}

\MREVISION{C6}{The \INDEX{mutation score} captures, in percentage points, the quality of a test suite. It measures the percentage of mutants that had been killed by the test suite.} 
The mutation testing process is driven by the mutation score; the process iterates multiple times until the mutation score reaches a certain threshold. 


\REVTWO{C7}{Despite the literature does not include studies concerning the identification of a threshold that guarantees that the test suite has a high fault detection rate (e.g., higher than branch coverage adequacy), the data reported in Checkam's work show that the mutation score of the best test suites is above 75\%. The value 75\% might thus be considered as a \INDEX{threshold} for terminating the mutation testing process.}
