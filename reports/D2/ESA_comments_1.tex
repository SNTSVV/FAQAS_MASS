Yes, it might be wort performing research addressing it; however the amount of work to be performed might require an extension of the current project. There are two main difficulties in performing such a study:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Such a study should evaluate the fault detection effectiveness of a test suite with a certain mutation score when it is applied to detect real fault. For this reason it should be performed with a set of real faults affecting the case study system; we do not have such a set for now.
\item Ideally, we should evaluate multiple test suites for a same case study; each test suite having a different mutation score. This can be easily achieved when it is possible to automatically generate test cases. However, for some of our case study systems (e.g., ESAIL) the automated generation of test cases might not be easily achieved since we mainly test the whole system not single units.
\end{enumerate}

Thank you for the interesting comment.

In case someone is interested in evaluating all the mutants it is sufficient to apply the strategy to select all the mutants (or 100\% of the mutants).

If the objective is not to reach 100\% mutation score but 75\%, if the estimated mutation score is already close enough (e.g., 69\%) it might be sufficient to generate test cases that kill all the sampled mutants (i.e., to achieve 100\% coverage of the sampled mutants). Such test cases may cover new behaviours that kill other mutants in addition to the ones already evaluated, thus in the next mutants evaluation round we may observe an estimated mutation score of 70\%. It might be interesting to evaluate if it is more cost effective to repeatedly sample mutants and generate test cases that kill them or to execute all the mutants and then generate test cases that kill enough mutants to reach 75\% mutation score.

We believe it is safer to exclude hardware in the loop as indicate in the SSS document. There might be many unexpected drawbacks in applying mutation testing to the real hardware. For example, we cannot predict the consequences of mutation testing altering the value used by an assembly instruction.

Yes it relates to comment PTCR-PABG-12. It should be worth investigating the proportion of real faults detected by test suites with different mutation scores. For that, case studies should come with real faults tracked by developers. It might be interesting to have faults tracked in different moments of the development process (i.e., from the initial development phases to validation and production). I'm not sure if all the companies keep track of every fault.

(a) Yes, we can provide statement coverage. We compute it anyway.
(b) By default KLEE aims to maximize statement coverage. However, we may not be able to commit for the use of KLEE as a test suite augmentation tool besides mutants coverage.

We did not have results for $ESAIL_S$ yet. Concerning ESAIL, which leads to 121848 mutants, it is not feasible to compute the mutation score considering all the mutants.

No, the reduce part refers to reducing the size of the test suite, which means that we select a subset of the test cases that cover the mutant.

We will be able to provide more details about test suite generation only after developing the approach. This will require few months of work.

\begin{minipage}{12cm}
There is a recent project that generates mutants and generate test cases to kill them~\footnote{https://github.com/thierry-tct/muteria}. The main problem of that work is that mutants are injected at the intermediate representation level. The author is an SnT alumni and we are in contact with him to involve him for the test suite augmentation part.

We can update D2 after defining the data-driven mutation testing process more in detail. As we did for code-driven, what we can do is to integrate the research paper we will write on the topic.

Our problem is that, without a system using the DataTypesSimulink.asn grammar, we cannot evaluate the usefulness of data-driven mutation testing as a test suites evaluation approach.
