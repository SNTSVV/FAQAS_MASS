\begin{minipage}{12cm}
Compile time optimizations appear not to be necessary if a smart compilation process is in place. Basically, the compilation routine that we propose (i.e., copy the mutated file inside a compiled source tree) is somehow an optimization.
\end{minipage}\\

\begin{minipage}{12cm}
We agree. For FAQAS, we are already addressing the problem of collecting fine-grained code coverage for ESAL (there is no filesystem thus gcov needs to be combined with gdb, according to guidelines from Thanassis Tsiodras at https://www.thanassis.space/coverage.html). To address the comment, we included the research questions RQ7 and RQ9.

Since these distances have nothing to do with mutation testing but it is part of our contribution, we prefer to not add to D1 (we would not have an appropriate section for them). If necessary we can provide additional description in D2.

KLEE appear more mature than CBMC, it is our primary choice at this stage.

The licence of both CBMC and KLEE appear to be compatible. The simplest solution is to not release CBMC/KLEE with the FAQAS framework but require their installation in a specific folder as a dependency.

\EMPH{Does Mull work at source code level, or only on IR level?.} 
Mull work only on IR level.
\EMPH{Does Mull force you to use the clang compiler? If so, that could be an argument to de-scope the tool, since we would like tools able to work on source code, independently of the compiler being used.}
Yes it does. Mull's approach relies completely on the use of the clang compiler. Clang is used along all the steps of the mutation testing process (e.g., from compilation to runtime optimizations).
We made this aspect clearer in Section~\ref{subsec:mull}.
\end{minipage}\\
\hline
CSR-PABG-26&
\begin{minipage}{12cm}
Both Dextool and Accmut mutation toolsets require as an input an intermediate representation version of the software (i.e., bitcode files) to perform the mutation testing process. Unfortunately, this is only possible by forcing the compilation with Clang, and thus, the clang parser is not enough to generate mutants.

We suggest to provide such research question for the end of WP2.

In Section~\ref{sec:dataProcess} we tried to better justify why we do not target faults in the computing hardware. 
\end{minipage}\\
\hline
CSR-PABG-30&
\begin{minipage}{12cm}
See comment above. Also, a solution targeting such fault would be completely different than a solution targeting different components (i.e., what we are proposing now).

We tried to clarify the reasons for implementing two distinct solutions in Section~\ref{sec:data:test_suite_evaluation}.

\hline
CSR-PABG-32&
\begin{minipage}{12cm}
The example is correct, but the keyword we used might be misleading (i.e.,  \EMPH{mutation operation instances} and \EMPH{mutation operators}).
There are five \EMPH{mutation operation instances}, while we have four \EMPH{mutation operators}. A same mutation operator may lead to more than one mutation operation instances. The text describes such situation (i.e., \emph{The fault model IfHK leads to  ve mutation operation instances: one for each of the two BF mutation operators, one for the VAR operator, and two for the VOR mutation operator}).

The fault model joins modelling of data and faults. An example follows in Figure~\ref{fig:dataMutationFMExamples}.
\end{minipage}\\

CSR-PABG-33&
\begin{minipage}{12cm}
Yes, the operators will be implemented for both ASN.1 and data buffers.

CSR-PABG-43&
\begin{minipage}{12cm}
We apologize for the mismatch. The number of lines of code appearing in Section~\ref{chapter:caseStudies:LXS} of D2  was computed by SnT in January 2020 and initially reported in ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-004-ProgressReport.pdf. At that stage of the project SnT did not have full understanding of the system. SnT relied on a simple batch script based on the "wc" lines count tool which, unfortunately, included in the counting also code comments and, moreover, the source code of the simulator (i.e., SVF) itself, which is not supposed to be tested. The reference numbers should be the ones provided by LXS.
\TODO{Oscar: please check}.
\end{minipage}\\
\hline
CSR-PABG-44&
\begin{minipage}{12cm}
We added a brief description in Section~\ref{sec:caseStudies:GSL:libgcsp} about the test framework, test suite and HPC configuration used in the GSL case studies.
\end{minipage}\\
\hline
CSR-PABG-45&
\begin{minipage}{12cm}
We clarified in Section~\ref{sec:caseStudies:GSL:libgcsp} that the use case libgscsp is covering integration testing.

CSR-PABG-46&
\begin{minipage}{12cm}
\EMPH{We should be assessing a test suite as a whole, and if some statements are not covered, this is already a sign that the test suite may not be complete enough.} 
If a statement is not covered by the test suite, there is absolutely no chance that a mutant generated in the non-covered statement can be possibly detected by any test case (see killing conditions of a mutant in D1 Section 1.3.1). For this reason, we make the assumption that test suites are of high quality standards, and therefore, we consider only the covered statements. If the test suite does not reach the required coverage there is no reason to perform mutation testing, it is already known that the test suite is not good.
\EMPH{When computing the mutation score, is it fare to not count those not-covered lines?}
Yes, is it fare because mutation testing assess the quality of existing test suites, and considering non-covered statements would be out of the scope of the technique. Also, including non-covered statements into the mutation score, would not let us to assess correctly the quality of the existing test suite.
\EMPH{Maybe the approach would be to run the test augmentation process to provide test cases for the missing statements?}
Yes, the same tools used for test augmentation can be used. We can run them. The main difference is that oracles  for the generated test cases should be manually specified (in the case of test augmentation we may derive the oracle based on the values generated by KLEE/CBMC). However, the evaluation of these generated test suites through mutation testing address a different research question than the one of the project; i.e., we would evaluate test automation tools instead of manual test suites.
