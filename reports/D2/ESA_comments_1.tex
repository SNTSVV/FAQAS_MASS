We may perform an experiment in line with the one performed in reference~\cite{CChekam:17}.
The objective of the experiment would be to identify a mutation score that ensures that the fault revealing power of a test suite is greater than the one of a test suite that simply achieves statement coverage adequacy (i.e., all the statements are covered). More precisely, we may aim to identify a threshold for the mutation score that ensures that a test suite with a mutation score above the given threshold detects all the mutants detected by a test suite that achieves statements coverage adequacy.

The experiment will be performed by considering all the case study systems for FAQAS.
For every case study system, we consider the original test suite, $\mathit{TS}_o$, which achieves 100\% coverage of non dead code, and an extended test suite, $\mathit{TS}_e$, that consists of the same test cases of $\mathit{TS}_o$ plus a set of test cases automatically generated to kill the mutants. The extended test suite achieves a mutation score $ms_e$ that is greater than the mutation score $\mathit{ms}_o$ of the original test suite. For example, we may have $\mathit{ms}_o=0.7$ and $\mathit{ms}_e=0.9$.

The experiment can be conducted by dividing the interval between $m_o$ and $m_i$ into $n$ ranges (e.g., 4 ranges), such that we can define $\delta = (\mathit{ms}_e - \mathit{ms}_o)/n$ and have each of the $n$ ranges defined as the interval between $\mathit{ms}_o+(n-1)*\delta$ and $\mathit{ms}_o+n*\delta$.
For every case study, for each of the $n$ ranges, we can generate $M$ test suites  (e.g., 10) by randomly selecting test cases belonging to $\mathit{TS}_i$ till we achieve a mutation score in the given range.
For each i-th test suite belonging to the range $n$ (i.e., $\mathit{TS}_{n,i}$), we compute the mutation score (i.e., $ms_{n,i}$).
Also, we compute the \emph{mutation score delta} as $msd_{n,i}=ms_{n,i}-ms_o$. Each test suite in the range $n$ enable us to study the fault revealing power of a test suite with a mutation score above the threshold $T=(n-1)*\delta$.

For each range $n$ we can perform a one sample t-test to reject the null hypothesis $msd_{n} = 0$ in favor of the alternate hypothesis $msd_{n} > 0$, at a 5\% alpha level.
If the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternate hypothesis then the threshold $T=(n-1)*\delta$ ensures to achieve better fault detection than statement coverage adequacy.
Alternatively, we may perform a one sample wilcoxon-signed-rank test, which evaluates whether the median of the sample is greater than zero.

%alternatively we may perform a one sample wilcoxon-signed-rank

Mull work only on IR level.
\EMPH{Does Mull force you to use the clang compiler? If so, that could be an argument to de-scope the tool, since we would like tools able to work on source code, independently of the compiler being used.}
Yes it does. Mull's approach relies completely on the use of the clang compiler. Clang is used along all the steps of the mutation testing process (e.g., from compilation to runtime optimizations).
We made this aspect clearer in Section~\ref{subsec:mull}.

Both Dextool and Accmut mutation toolsets require as an input an intermediate representation version of the software (i.e., bitcode files) to perform the mutation testing process.

The example is correct, but the keyword we used might be misleading (i.e.,  \EMPH{mutation operation instances} and \EMPH{mutation operators}).
There are five \EMPH{mutation operation instances}, while we have four \EMPH{mutation operators}. A same mutation operator may lead to more than one mutation operation instances. The text describes such situation (i.e., \emph{The fault model IfHK leads to  ve mutation operation instances: one for each of the two BF mutation operators, one for the VAR operator, and two for the VOR mutation operator}).

The fault model joins modelling of data and faults. An example follows in Figure~\ref{fig:dataMutationFMExamples}.

We apologize for the mismatch. The number of lines of code appearing in Section~\ref{chapter:caseStudies:LXS} of D2  was computed by SnT in January 2020 and initially reported in ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-004-ProgressReport.pdf. At that stage of the project, SnT did not have full understanding of the system. SnT relied on  the "cloc" lines count tool, which was applied to the project root. With that set-up, unfortunately,  "cloc" included in the counting also the source code of the simulator (i.e., SVF) itself, which is not supposed to be tested. LXS, instead, relies on VectorCast to measure code coverage. In addition to the difference in the selection of the components to measure, a major difference between "cloc" and VectorCast is that VectorCast does not count the lines of code that belong to preprocessor directives (e.g. '\#define'). VectorCast counts only executable statements. Further investigations are on-going.

\EMPH{We should be assessing a test suite as a whole, and if some statements are not covered, this is already a sign that the test suite may not be complete enough.} 
If a statement is not covered by the test suite, there is absolutely no chance that a mutant generated in the non-covered statement can be possibly detected by any test case (see killing conditions of a mutant in D1 Section 1.3.1). For this reason, we make the assumption that test suites are of high quality standards, and therefore, we consider only the covered statements. If the test suite does not reach the required coverage there is no reason to perform mutation testing, it is already known that the test suite is not good.
\EMPH{When computing the mutation score, is it fare to not count those not-covered lines?}
Yes, is it fare because mutation testing assess the quality of existing test suites, and considering non-covered statements would be out of the scope of the technique. Also, including non-covered statements into the mutation score, would not let us to assess correctly the quality of the existing test suite.
\EMPH{Maybe the approach would be to run the test augmentation process to provide test cases for the missing statements?}
Yes, the same tools used for test augmentation can be used. We can run them. The main difference is that oracles  for the generated test cases should be manually specified (in the case of test augmentation we may derive the oracle based on the values generated by KLEE/CBMC). However, the evaluation of these generated test suites through mutation testing address a different research question than the one of the project; i.e., we would evaluate test automation tools instead of manual test suites.

\EMPH{Is there any strategy for these mutants? Are they discarded from the beginning?} As described in the Step 3 of the Space Software Mutation Testing Process (see Section~\ref{codeDriven:stepThree}), the mutants leading to compilation errors will be discarded from the beginning and they will not be considered.
\EMPH{Is there any way to prevent their generation?}
Yes, the mutation testing tool could be improved by providing more contextual information about the operands being mutated. For example, by applying the mutation $+ \rightarrow \%$ in the expression \texttt{a + b}, where \texttt{a} is an int and \texttt{b} is a float, would lead to a compilation error since the $\%$ operator should take only integers. In an improved version of the toolset, this mutation could be avoided (i.e, since \texttt{b} is a float) with the use of contextual information.

\begin{minipage}{12cm}
\EMPH{Is this part of the SVF? Does the SVF contain OBC and ADCS\_IF\_SW?} Yes, the SVF simulator runs the OBC software but it simulates the behaviour of the ADCS\_IF\_SW. The ADCS\_IF\_SW is not run inside the OBC but only simulated.
\EMPH{What is the test suite to be used in this case?} The ESAIL system test suite contains test cases that exercise the integration between OBC and the ADCS\_IF\_SW but the ADCS\_IF\_SW is not actually run. The test suite that exercises the ADCS\_IF\_SW is the one the should execute with hardware in the loop.
\EMPH{Messages OBC->ADCS\_IF\_SW should also be possible to test, right?} Yes but not with the current test suite. Indeed the simulator used in the current test suite makes assumptions about the messages received thus it would be very easy to break it by altering its input messages. To alter the messages sent from OBC to ADCS\_IF\_SW it would be necessary to (1) use a simulator that actually runs the ADCS\_IF\_SW or (2) target the test cases that include hardware in the loop.
%there are least four test cases (i.e., the 2985, 6583, 2411, and the 2604) that exercise the sending of messages of OBC->ADCS\_IF\_SW.

\begin{minipage}{12cm}
Testing with hardware in the loop is technically feasible because it is just a matter of deploying on the hardware a modified software that performs the mutation. However mutated packets may break some of the assumptions made when developing the software and thus break the hardware (e.g., altering the voltage of the board). For every mutation to be performed it might be necessary to ensure that the hardware is not going to be damaged. Such type of testing might thus be out of the budget for the current project and may require a dedicated project by itself.
