\section{ASN1CC}
\label{sec:caseStudies:GSL:ASN1}

\subsection{Overview of the case study}

ASN1SCC is an open source ASN.1 compiler that generates C/C++ and SPARK/Ada code suitable for low resource environments such as space systems. Moreover, the compiler can produce a test harness that provides full statement coverage in the generated code, and therefore significantly improves its quality.

Details about ASN.1 compiler are provided in the document \emph{taste-documentation-current.pdf} uploaded on Alfresco.

In the context of FAQAS, we focus our analysis on the auto-generated source code by the ASN.1 compiler, rather than in ASN1SCC software itself.

For the definition of the ASN.1 compiler case study, we introduce the example of a specific grammar. An excerpt of such grammar is shown in Listing~\ref{asn_excerpt}. The full source code of the grammar can be found in the file \emph{test.asn} uploaded on Alfresco.

For the given grammar, the size of the auto-generated source code is 4\,338 LOC. While the unit test suite consists of 107 auto-generated test cases.

\subsection{Code-driven mutation testing}

\input{tables/asn1grammar_coverage}

Table~\ref{table:asn1grammar_coverage} provides the code coverage information of the auto-generated source code of the \emph{test.asn} grammar. Given the code coverage, we focus our code-driven mutation testing analysis to the following subset of components (i.e., components with code coverage greater than 0\%):

\begin{itemize}
	\item asn1crt\_encoding.c: implementation of the ASN.1 constraints encoding/decoding procedures.
	\item test.c: implementation of the grammar data types encoding/decoding procedures.
	\item test\_auto\_tcs.c: wrapper of the grammar data types encoding/decoding procedures used in the test cases.
\end{itemize}
