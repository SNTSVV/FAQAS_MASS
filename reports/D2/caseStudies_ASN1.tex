The results of the FAQAS project will be evaluated against four case study system, listed below:

\begin{itemize}
	%\item LuxSpace - Unit Test Suite for ESAIL - CSW
	\item LuxSpace - System Test Suite for ESAIL
	\item GomSpace - Unit Test Suite for libutil
	\item GomSpace - Unit Test Suite for libcsp
	\item MLSF mathematical library - https://essr.esa.int/project/mlfs-mathematical-library-for-
		flight-software
	\item ASN1 Compiler - https://github.com/ttsiodras/asn1scc
\end{itemize}

Each case study system consists of a test suite, 
and a software component tested by the test suite (i.e., the component to be mutated by the FAQAS framework). They are described in the following sections.
