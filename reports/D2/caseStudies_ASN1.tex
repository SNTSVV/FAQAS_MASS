\section{ASN1CC}
\label{sec:caseStudies:GSL:ASN1}

\subsection{Overview of the case study}

ASN1SCC is an open source ASN.1 compiler that generates C/C++ and SPARK/Ada code suitable for low resource environments such as space systems. Moreover, the compiler can produce a test harness that provides full statement coverage in the generated code, and therefore significantly improves its quality.

Details about ASN.1 compiler are provided in the document \emph{taste-documentation-current.pdf} uploaded on Alfresco.

In the context of FAQAS, we focus our analysis on the auto-generated source code by the ASN.1 compiler, rather than in ASN1SCC software itself.

For the definition of the ASN.1 compiler case study, we introduce the example of a specific grammar. An excerpt of such grammar is shown in Listing~\ref{asn_excerpt}. The full source code of the grammar can be found in the file \emph{test.asn} uploaded on Alfresco.

For the given grammar, the size of the auto-generated source code is 4\,338 LOC. While the unit test suite consists of 107 auto-generated test cases.

\subsection{Code-driven mutation testing}

\input{tables/asn1grammar_coverage}

Table~\ref{table:asn1grammar_coverage} provides the code coverage information of the auto-generated source code of the \emph{test.asn} grammar. Given the code coverage, we focus our code-driven mutation testing analysis to the following subset of components (i.e., components with code coverage greater than 0\%):

\begin{itemize}
	\item asn1crt\_encoding.c: implementation of the ASN.1 constraints encoding/decoding procedures.
	\item test.c: implementation of the grammar data types encoding/decoding procedures.
	\item test\_auto\_tcs.c: wrapper of the grammar data types encoding/decoding procedures used in the test cases.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mutation Testing Preliminary Results}

\input{tables/asn1_preliminary}

In order to analyze the feasibility of the code-driven mutation testing for ASN.1, we conducted a preliminary experimentation using the mutation operators AOR, ROR, ICR, LCR, ABS, UOI and SDL we generated 9\,174 mutants. Preliminary results can be found in Table~\ref{table:asn1_preliminary}.
Particularly, we observe that from the 9\,174 generated mutants, we had 1\,215 mutants that were not compiled by the compilation toolset of ASN.1, most probably because the mutation introduced a syntactical error that was detected by the toolset.
Then, we identified 4\,263 live mutants that were not detected by the test suite. Instead, we had 3\,009 killed mutants detected by the test suite, and 687 mutants that produced libutil to go into an infinite loop, and thus were killed by timeout. The final mutation score was of 53.56\%.

The identification of equivalent mutants still needs to be assessed.
