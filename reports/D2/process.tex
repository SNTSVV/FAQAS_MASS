Figure~\ref{fig:code:process} shows the reference code-driven mutation testing process that will be considered in this book. The process depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:code:process} has been inspired by the mutation testing process described in related work~\cite{offutt2001mutation,papadakis2019mutation}, it has been presented in deliverable D1. The process is based on two main sub-processes, \emph{test suite evaluation} and \emph{test suite augmentation}, which are described in Sections~\ref{sec:testSuiteEvaluation:codeDriven}~and~\ref{sec:testGeneration:codeDriven}, respectively.
