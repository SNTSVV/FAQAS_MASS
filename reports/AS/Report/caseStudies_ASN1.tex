\section{ASN1SCC}
\label{sec:caseStudies:GSL:ASN1}

\subsection{Overview of the case study}

\INDEX{ASN1SCC} is an open source ASN.1 compiler that generates C/C++ and SPARK/Ada code suitable for low resource environments such as space systems. Moreover, the compiler can produce a test harness that provides full statement coverage in the generated code, and therefore significantly improves its quality.


In the context of FAQAS, we focus our analysis on the auto-generated source code by the ASN.1 compiler, rather than in ASN1SCC software itself.

For the definition of the ASN.1 compiler case study, we introduce the example of a specific grammar. An excerpt of such grammar is shown in Listing~\ref{asn_excerpt}. 
The excerpt of the grammar introduces the definition of six data types, each data type also specifies the expected constraint, for example, the data type \texttt{MyInt} is an INTEGER which can have values from 0 to 20. The full source code of the grammar can be found in the file \emph{test.asn} uploaded on Alfresco.

For the given grammar, the size of the auto-generated source code is 4\,338 LOC. While the unit test suite consists of 107 auto-generated test cases.
