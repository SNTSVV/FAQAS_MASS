\chapter{Introduction}

This document is the Software Product Assurance Plan (SPAP) of the software delivered by the ESA activity ITT-1-9873-ESA (i.e., the \emph{FAQAS framework}).
The FAQAS framework consists of the following software: a toolset  implementing code-driven mutation analysis (\MASS), a toolset implementing code-driven test generation (\SEMUS), a toolset implementing data-driven mutation analysis (\DAMA).

\chapter{Applicable and reference documents}

% The SPAP shall list the applicable and reference documents to support the generation of the document.

\begin{itemize}
\item{D1 - Mutation testing survey}
\item{D2 - Study of mutation testing applicability to space software}
\item{D4 - Validation of the toolset}
\item{SSS - Requirements Baseline/Software System Specification}
\item{SUTP - Software Unit Test Plan}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Terms, definitions and abbreviated terms}

\begin{itemize}
\item{FAQAS}: activity ITT-1-9873-ESA
\item{FAQAS-framework}: software system to be released at the end of WP4 of FAQAS
%\item{D2}: Deliverable D2 of FAQAS, \emph{Study of mutation testing applicability to space software}

\chapter{System Overview}

The overview of the software system is described in the Software System Specification document (SSS).
The pre-qualification activities are conducted according to ECSS-E-ST-40 and ECSS-Q-ST-80 standards for software criticality category D.

The FAQAS project is developed for ESA by a consortium composed by: SnT (University of Luxembourg), LXS (LuxSpace), and GSL (GomSpace Luxembourg).
