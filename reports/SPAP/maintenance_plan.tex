\chapter{Software Maintenance Plan}
\label{chapter:maintenance}
% This document is the Software Maintenance Plan (SMP) for the Basic mathematical Library (BL) and the Basic mathematical Library Test Suite (BLTS) of the Mathematical Library for Flight Software (MLFS) project. It is composed of this document itself, its accompanying resources for the maintenance tasks E1356-GTD-SMP-01a, and the template for NCR submission E1356-GTD-SMP-01b.
% Its purpose is to provide the definition of organizational aspects and management approach to the implementation of the maintenance tasks and to describe the approach to the implementation of the maintenance process for this software product.
% GTD GmbH developed the software but the maintenance of the MLFS library is not part of the contract, thus this plan will define how to act in case of a required maintenance but will not define resources and schedule aspects of the maintenance process.
% The software maintenance plan is a constituent of the maintenance file (MF).
