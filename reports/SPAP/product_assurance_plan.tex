% EXPECTED OUTPUT: Statement of compliance with test plans and procedures [PAF, -; CDR, QR, AR, ORR].

% 6.3.5.15
% a. Areas affected by any modification shall be identified and re‐tested (regression testing).
% 6.3.5.16
% a. In case of re‐testing, all test related documentation (test procedures, data and reports) shall be updated accordingly.
% EXPECTED OUTPUT: Updated test documentation [DJF, -; CDR, QR, AR, ORR].

% 6.3.5.18
% a. The need for regression testing and additional verification of the software shall be analysed after a change or update of any tool used to generate it.
% NOTE For example: source code or object code.
% EXPECTED OUTPUT: Updated test documentation

% 7.1.3 Assurance activities for product quality requirements
% a. The supplier shall define assurance activities to ensure that the product meets the quality requirements as specified in the technical specification.
% EXPECTED OUTPUT: Software product assurance plan [PAF, SPAP; SRR, PDR].

\section{Software product assurance programme implementation}

\subsection{Organization}
\label{subsec:organization}
% a. The SPAP shall describe the organization of software product assurance activities, including responsibility, authority and the interrelation of personnel who manage, perform and verify work affecting software quality.
% b. The following topics shall be included:
% 1. organizational structure;
% 2. interfaces of each organisation, either external or internal, involved in the project;
% 3. relationship to the system level product assurance and safety;
% 4. independence of the software product assurance function;
% 5. delegation of software product assurance tasks to a lower level supplier, if any

The product assurance activities will be performed following the team organization defined in Chapter~\ref{chapter:organization}.

\subsection{Resources}
The human resources needed to ensure the project assurance are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Software PA Manager, identified in section~\ref{sec:resp}%for example
\end{itemize}

The software needed to perform the related activities is listed in Table~\ref{table:software_resources}.
