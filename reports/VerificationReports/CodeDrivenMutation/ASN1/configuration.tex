\chapter{Configuration of the toolset}

In this chapter we provide specific configurations of MASS and SEMuS to enable code-driven mutation testing in the ASN.1 case study.

Concerning the configuration of the \textbf{MASS toolset}, the only configurations we considered were the ones regarding the disregarding of equivalent and duplicate mutants with trivial compiler optimizations, and the one concerning the use of sampling.
In the case of trivial compiler optimisations we enabled all levels of optimizations permitted by GCC, that is, levels O0, O1, O2, O3, fast, and Os. 
In the case of sampling, since the test suite execution is fast (i.e., approximately 30 milliseconds), and the number of mutants is reduced (i.e., less than 10\,000) we decided to analyze all the mutants generated by the tool, and do not employ sampling methods.
