\chapter{Executive Summary}

This document is a report on the issues identified via Data-driven Mutation Analysis, on the ESAIL-ADCS case study using the \DAMA tool, which has been developed in the context of the \FAQAS.

\DAMA is a data-driven mutation analysis tool. It generates mutants by modiying the data contained in the SUT buffers throught the insertion in the source code of Mutation Probes. The mutation probes generate mutants following mutation operators defined in a Fault Model.

The code we analyzed was the ESAIL SVF test suite, which evaluetes the ESAIL OBSW and in particular the test cases regarding the interaction between the ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control System) component and the OBSW (On Board Software).
