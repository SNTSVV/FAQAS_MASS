\chapter{Deliverables Summary}

This chapter presents a summary of the deliverables of the FAQAS project. 

In the following, we introduce the full list of deliverables alongside a brief summary of its content.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-D1}: The deliverable D1 is called ``Fault-based Automated Quality assurance of Test Suites: A Survey of Mutation Testing and Test Suite Augmentation Approaches for Satellite and Embedded Systems''. This document presents an overview of mutation testing, and a comprehensive state-of-the-art of the methodology. It also includes mutation testing benchmarks, and the latest mutation testing trends.

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-D2}: The deliverable D2 is called ``Study of mutation testing applicability''. The document introduces for each approach (i.e., code-driven mutation analysis, code-driven mutation testing, data-driven mutation analysis, and data-driven mutation testing) a feasibility study, an assessment of the state-of-the-art, and finally the definition of a methodology for the specific problem. 

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-D4}: The deliverable D4 is called ``Validation of the toolset''. The document introduces the case studies of the FAQAS project and fully describes its characteristics. Moreover, for each methodology defined in FAQAS, the document includes an empirical evaluation for systematically validating the approach. 

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-D5}: The deliverable D5 is called ``Evaluation of mutation testing process and methodology definition''. The document introduces for each methodology defined in FAQAS, a brief description of the approach, and highlights the benefits of its use in the space software context. 

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-IRD}: The deliverable IRD is called ``Software Interface Requirements Document''. The document defines for each toolset, the external interfaces and the operational environment. The document also delivers information about the system interface requirements. 

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-SCF}: The deliverable SCF is called ``Software Configuration File''. The document fully describes the software deliverables of the FAQAS project (i.e., MASS, SEMuS, DAMAt, and DAMTe), it also describes the development track platform, and lists the baseline documents of the project.

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-SDD}: The deliverable SDD is called ``Software Design Document''. The document describes for each FAQAS toolset, the software architecture, the software components design, the software behavior, the internal interface design, the external interface design, and test harness.

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-SPAP}: The deliverable SPAP is called ``Software Product Assurance and Planning''. The document fully describes, the ECSS tailoring, the software development plan, the software validation plan, the software verification plan, the software maintenance plan, and the software product assurance plan.

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-SRelD}: The deliverable SRelD is called ``Software Release Document''. The document provides a status of the delivered software, and defines the potential problems of the issued software.

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-SRF}: The deliverable SRF is called ``Software Reuse File''. The document provides a description of the reused software in the FAQAS framework. It also includes information about the licensing of the reused components.

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-SSS}: The deliverable SSS is called ``Software System Specification'', and provides a complete list of requirements of the FAQAS framework, and for each toolset.

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-SUM}: The deliverable SUM is called ``Software User Manual''. The document fully describes the requirements and procedures for running the FAQAS toolset (i.e., MASS, SEMuS, DAMAt, and DAMTe). It also includes a tutorial for each of the toolset.

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-SUTP}: The deliverable SUTP is called ``Software Unit Test Plan''. The document describes for each FAQAS toolset, the unit testing approach, unit testing design, unit testing specifications and unit testing procedures.

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-SUTR}: The deliverable SUTR is called ``Software Unit Test Report''. The document reports the outcome of the unit testing procedures described in the SUTP document, there is a dedicated chapter for each FAQAS toolset.

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-SValR}: The deliverable SValR is called ``Software Validation Report'', and specifies for each toolset the outcome of the validation procedures defined in the SPAP document.

	\item \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-SVS}: The deliverable SVS is called ``Software Validation Specification''. The document provides a mapping between requirements and testing procedures.
