\chapter{Scientific output}

The FAQAS activity led to the publication of a scientific paper about MASS, the paper appears in IEEE Transactions on Software engineering~\cite{Oscar:MASS:TSE}, which is the top software engineering journal.
A paper describing DAMAt has been submitted for peer review to a top software engineering conference in September 2021. A paper describing SEMuS will be submitted for peer review to a top software engineering conference towards the beginning of 2022. Given the typical duration of the pee-review process for top scientific venues (e.g., nine months between submission and acceptance, for our accepted paper), the FAQAS consortium considers the achieved results highly satisfactory.
