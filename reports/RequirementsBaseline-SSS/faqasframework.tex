\section{Function and Purpose}

The FAQAS activity concerns the investigation of mutation testing as a method to evaluate the quality of software test suites and mutation testing as a method to derive new software test cases.

The \FAQAS shall support a code-driven and data-driven mutation testing methodology that integrates and extends state-of-art solutions. The reference methodology has been described in D2. The methodology enables a scalable and accurate mutation testing process even when the software under test is large and characterized by test suites requiring long execution time.

The end-user of the \FAQAS is a software engineer (i.e., a professional with a master degree in informatics or related fields)  who aims to evaluate the quality of the test suite developed for a flight software component or system. Hereafter, the end-user of \FAQAS is referred to as \emph{the engineer}.

Since \FAQAS implements two distinct features, code-driven mutation testing and data-driven mutation testing, this document contains two separate sections, each one concerning one of the two features: Section~\ref{sec:codeDriven} concerns code-driven mutation testing, Section~\ref{sec:dataDriven} concerns data-driven mutation testing.

The requirements defined in this chapter are univocally identified by the paragraph id appearing on the left.

\section{General Constraints}

\REVISION{P-3}{\RQ{} Test suite evaluation for code-driven mutation testing shall be based on SRCIror\footnote{https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/srciror} (detailed motivation is provided in D2).}

\RQ{} The automated generation of test cases (i.e., the objective of test suite augmentation) shall rely on existing tools because it is an open, complex, research problem.

\RQ{} The automated generation of test cases for code-mutation may rely on KLEE, which is the most stable test case generation tool, based on WP2 evaluation.


\section{Software Architecture}

\RQ{} \REVISION{P-4}{\FAQAS shall follow a modular architecture. The FAQAS Architecture is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}. The FAQAS system shall consists of four components 
\begin{itemize}
\item MASS (Mutation Analysis for Space Software), which implements test suite evaluation based on code-driven mutation.
\item SEMuS (Symbolic Execution-based Mutation testing for Space), which implements test suite augmentation based on code-driven mutation.
\item DAMA (Data-driven Mutation Analysis), which implements test suite evaluation based on data-driven mutation.
\item DAMTE (DAta-driven Mutation TEsting), which implements test suite augmentation based on data-driven mutation.
\end{itemize}}

\RQ{} \REVISION{P-4}{At high-level, the four \FAQAS components shall work as follows. All the components receive as input the software under test (SUT), the test suite to evaluate (SUT Test Suite), and a set of configurations. MASS generates a set of code-driven mutants, the mutation score, and a list of live mutants. SEMuS receive as input the list of live mutants and generate test cases that kill them. DAMA generates a set of data-driven mutants, the mutation score, and a list of live mutants. DAMTE receive as input the list of live data-driven mutants and generate test cases that kill them.}
