This document is the deliverable D5 of the ESA activity ITT-1-9873-ESA. Following the structure described in the SoW \emph{AO9873-ws00pe\_SOW.pdf} it describes the methodology to follow in order to assess and improve a test suite using the FAQAS toolset (see Chapter~\ref{chapter:methodology}). In addition, within D5, we provide the result of a validation campaign independently conducted by GomSpace and LuxSpace; however, the results of such campaign are reported in two separate documents: \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-D5-FAQAS\_Toolset\_GSL\_Assessment.pdf} (GomSpace) and \emph{ITT-1-9873-ESA-FAQAS-D5-FAQAS\_Toolset\_LXS\_Assessment.pdf} (Luxspace).
