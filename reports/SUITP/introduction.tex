\chapter{Scope and content}

This document is the combined Software Unit and Integration Test Plan of the software delivered by the ESA activity ITT-1-9873-ESA (i.e., the \emph{FAQAS framework}). Its purpose is to describe the unit and integration tests to be done for the \FAQAS.
The FAQAS framework consists of the following software: a toolset  implementing code-driven mutation analysis (MASS), a toolset implementing code-driven test generation, a toolset implementing data-driven mutation analysis, a toolset implementing data-driven test generation.

This document follows the structure described in ECSS-E-ST-40C Annex B.
