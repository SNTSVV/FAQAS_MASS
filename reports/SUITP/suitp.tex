\chapter{Software Unit Testing and Software Integration Testing}

\section{Organization}

%\section{Master schedule}


\section{Resource Summary}

Unit tests make use of the \FAQAS. Tests will be performed in one hardware platform, a x86-64 desktop PC. Unit test execution time should not exceed one day for all target platforms combined.

\section{Responsibilities}

The unit tests are to be prepared by SnT personnel.

The tests will be conducted by a SnT specialist who will also have the responsibility of reporting any occurring software issues.

\section{Tool, techniques and methods}

Unit tests are specified in Bash files. Each unit test contains a launcher script that configures the environment for the correct execution of \FAQAS, and a source code example for its mutation. The launcher script will invoke a dedicated operator Bash script, that generates the corresponding mutants and assesses its results.

\section{Personnel and Personnel Training Requirements}

Unit testing can be performed by a single person using a general script. No special training is needed.

\section{Risks and Contingencies}

The unit testing campaign does not have any risk.
